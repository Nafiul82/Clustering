Clustering Analysis in R

This project explores and compares multiple clustering techniques applied to both simulated 2D datasets and real-world agricultural seed data. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of different clustering methods in grouping similar observations and measure how well the discovered clusters match the true labels.
